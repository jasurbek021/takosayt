                 this plugin you can send your Figma designs to Shopify in no-time. To get a better<br>
                  understanding how this works, please watch our <a class="and" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_tr3x3_Y6w&ab_channel=InstantPageBuilder">Figma to Shopify Tutorial.</a><br>
                  <br>
                Our recommended workflow is to get familiar with the structure of the sections<br>
                 used in the kit. Change the components to your own branding and content, then<br>
                  publish to Shopify via Instant. Any updates you make here inside Figma require a <br>
                  new copy + paste action.</p>
